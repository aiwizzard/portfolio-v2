                  Hi, I am Ajmal, a senior software developer with 4+ years of
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will say my specialty is Python since it is the main part of
                  most of my projects. I am most curious about engineering
                  systems, and machine learning specifically and actively doing
                  side projects. Also take part in the end-to-end project
                  pipeline, from planning to deploying to the mass. I Build
                  full-stack applications with Django, Django Rest Framework,
                  and react.
                </p>
                <p className="">
                  If I am being specific about my experience, I will say it is 4
                  years and 6 months. For the first 13 months, I was a freelance
                  developer. It was in the final year of my bachelor's degree. I
                  started by building small websites for friendsâ€™ relatives.
                  during this period I became experienced in Python and Django.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then after that college I joined a startup as software
                  developer. I was there for 2 years and 2 months. Here my work
                  included Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Flutter,
                  Machine Learning with PyTorch and deployment of back-end
                  services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After that, I joined{" "}

                  - a public limited company - as a Senior Software Developer
                  and remained there for 1 year and 3 months. My role was as a
                  Team Lead for back-end developers. During this tenure, I
                  mentored them, analyzed their work, and gave feedback. We
                  build lots of application back-ends with Django and Django
                  Rest Framework. Tinc was the main app. It is a platform for
                  Indian stock market traders which provided courses, gave the
                  news, view market data, and can trade. I was also Tasked with
                  deploying code to the server. For the lion's share of the
                  projects, I deployed them with Docker and docker-compose. For
                  some application that requires handling more load, I opt for
                  infrastructure as code (IAC), specifically Terraform on AWS.
